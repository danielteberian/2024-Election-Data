The data is taken from the government of each state, respectively. Data is only included if it is official (as in, it has been certified), and is from an official source.


States:

Delaware - A CSV file, retrieved from elections.delaware.gov.
Oklahoma - A CSV file that contains the results of the 2024 elections. Data is broken down by county. An additional version is included, where data is broken down by precinct.
South Carolina - An XML file, retrieved from enr-scvotes.gov.
Vermont - An XML file, taken from electionresults.vermont.gov.
Wyoming - Three CSV files, containing the results, taken from the Wyoming Secretary of State website.


Not Included:

Florida - Votes have been certified, but have not been added to the database on the dos.fl.gov website.
Mississippi - Not certified until December 6.
South Dakota - Votes have been certified and the data has been released, but I have not been able to find a format that works for this dataset. I will figure it out.
